# asy-geometry-doc
The source code of http://www.piprime.fr/files/res/geometry_en.pdf. 
This repository contains the documentation of the package "geometry", which is part of the Asymptote graphical languange
https://asymptote.sourceforge.io/. 
This Asymptote delivery contains the "geometry" package but without any documentation. Because of the complexity of this
library, it's nearly useless without lots of examples and documentation which is provided with this repository.

## Origin of this code
This code is forked from the original location
https://github.com/pivaldi/asymptote-geometry-documentation
on 13.02.2021, because the code doesn't compile and the repository is inactive for greater 10 years.

## Compile
To compile this code and get the manuals in pdf format in english and french, the following tools are required
+ a LaTeX installation with pdfLatex
+ the above mentioned Asymptote graphics program
+ pygmentize (python package)
+ the usual development tools like make, ...

## Support
I'm new to LaTeX, so I did only minor changes in order to get the sources compiling. Help for improving this very useful documentation is really welcome :-)
